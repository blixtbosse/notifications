Some shitty notifications inspired by FBRP. 

```LUA
exports.notifications:CreateNotification({
    text = 'You got 1 ~lg~phone~s~', -- What do you want to notify?
    icon = 'error', -- What icon do you want? Check out https://fonts.google.com/icons
    color = 'red' -- Color of the icon,
    timeout = 5000 -- Time in milliseconds,
})
```
